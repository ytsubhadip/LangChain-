LinearRegression
class sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression(*, fit_intercept=True, copy_X=True, tol=1e-06, n_jobs=None, positive=False)[source]
Ordinary least squares Linear Regression.

LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients w = (w1, …, wp) to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.

Parameters:
fit_interceptbool, default=True
Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set to False, no intercept will be used in calculations (i.e. data is expected to be centered).

copy_Xbool, default=True
If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

tolfloat, default=1e-6
The precision of the solution (coef_) is determined by tol which specifies the convergence criterion of the underlying solver. tol is set as atol and btol of scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr when fitting on sparse training data. tol is set as cond of scipy.linalg.lstsq when fitting on dense training data.

Added in version 1.7.

Changed in version 1.9: Now supported on dense data, interpreted as the cond parameter.

n_jobsint, default=None
The number of jobs to use for the computation. This will only provide speedup in case of sufficiently large problems, that is if firstly n_targets > 1 and secondly X is sparse or if positive is set to True. None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors. See Glossary for more details.

positivebool, default=False
When set to True, forces the coefficients to be positive. This option is only supported for dense arrays.

For a comparison between a linear regression model with positive constraints on the regression coefficients and a linear regression without such constraints, see Non-negative least squares.

Added in version 0.24.

Attributes:
coef_array of shape (n_features, ) or (n_targets, n_features)
Estimated coefficients for the linear regression problem. If multiple targets are passed during the fit (y 2D), this is a 2D array of shape (n_targets, n_features), while if only one target is passed, this is a 1D array of length n_features.

rank_int
Rank of matrix X. Only available when X is dense.

singular_array of shape (min(X, y),)
Singular values of X. Only available when X is dense.

intercept_float or array of shape (n_targets,)
Independent term in the linear model. Set to 0.0 if fit_intercept = False.

n_features_in_int
Number of features seen during fit.

Added in version 0.24.

feature_names_in_ndarray of shape (n_features_in_,)
Names of features seen during fit. Defined only when X has feature names that are all strings.

Added in version 1.0.

See also

Ridge
Ridge regression addresses some of the problems of Ordinary Least Squares by imposing a penalty on the size of the coefficients with l2 regularization.

Lasso
The Lasso is a linear model that estimates sparse coefficients with l1 regularization.

ElasticNet
Elastic-Net is a linear regression model trained with both l1 and l2 -norm regularization of the coefficients.

Notes

From the implementation point of view, this is just plain Ordinary Least Squares (scipy.linalg.lstsq) or Non Negative Least Squares (scipy.optimize.nnls) wrapped as a predictor object.

Examples

import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3]])
# y = 1 * x_0 + 2 * x_1 + 3
y = np.dot(X, np.array([1, 2])) + 3
reg = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
reg.score(X, y)
1.0
reg.coef_
array([1., 2.])
reg.intercept_
np.float64(3.0)
reg.predict(np.array([[3, 5]]))
array([16.])
fit(X, y, sample_weight=None)[source]
Fit linear model.

Parameters:
X{array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
Training data.

yarray-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets)
Target values. Will be cast to X’s dtype if necessary.

sample_weightarray-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
Individual weights for each sample.

Added in version 0.17: parameter sample_weight support to LinearRegression.

Returns:
self
object
Fitted Estimator.

get_metadata_routing()[source]
Get metadata routing of this object.

Please check User Guide on how the routing mechanism works.

Returns
:
routing
MetadataRequest
A MetadataRequest encapsulating routing information.

get_params(deep=True)[source]
Get parameters for this estimator.

Parameters
:
deep
bool, default=True
If True, will return the parameters for this estimator and contained subobjects that are estimators.

Returns
:
params
dict
Parameter names mapped to their values.

predict(X)[source]
Predict using the linear model.

Parameters
:
X
array-like or sparse matrix of shape (n_samples, n_features)
Samples.

Returns
:
C
ndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
Predicted values.

score(X, y, sample_weight=None)[source]
Return coefficient of determination on test data.

The coefficient of determination, 
, is defined as 
 
, where 
 is the residual sum of squares ((y_true - y_pred)** 2).sum() and 
 is the total sum of squares ((y_true - y_true.mean()) ** 2).sum(). The best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, would get a 
 score of 0.0.

Parameters
:
X
array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
Test samples. For some estimators this may be a precomputed kernel matrix or a list of generic objects instead with shape (n_samples, n_samples_fitted), where n_samples_fitted is the number of samples used in the fitting for the estimator.

y
array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
True values for X.

sample_weight
array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
Sample weights.

Returns
:
score
float
 of self.predict(X) w.r.t. y.

Notes

The 
 score used when calling score on a regressor uses multioutput='uniform_average' from version 0.23 to keep consistent with default value of r2_score. This influences the score method of all the multioutput regressors (except for MultiOutputRegressor).

set_fit_request(*, sample_weight: bool | None | str = '$UNCHANGED$') → LinearRegression[source]
Configure whether metadata should be requested to be passed to the fit method.

Note that this method is only relevant when this estimator is used as a sub-estimator within a meta-estimator and metadata routing is enabled with enable_metadata_routing=True (see sklearn.set_config). Please check the User Guide on how the routing mechanism works.

The options for each parameter are:

True: metadata is requested, and passed to fit if provided. The request is ignored if metadata is not provided.

False: metadata is not requested and the meta-estimator will not pass it to fit.

None: metadata is not requested, and the meta-estimator will raise an error if the user provides it.

str: metadata should be passed to the meta-estimator with this given alias instead of the original name.

The default (sklearn.utils.metadata_routing.UNCHANGED) retains the existing request. This allows you to change the request for some parameters and not others.

Added in version 1.3.

Parameters
:
sample_weight
str, True, False, or None, default=sklearn.utils.metadata_routing.UNCHANGED
Metadata routing for sample_weight parameter in fit.

Returns
:
self
object
The updated object.

set_params(**params)[source]
Set the parameters of this estimator.

The method works on simple estimators as well as on nested objects (such as Pipeline). The latter have parameters of the form <component>__<parameter> so that it’s possible to update each component of a nested object.

Parameters
:
**params
dict
Estimator parameters.

Returns
:
self
estimator instance
Estimator instance.

set_score_request(*, sample_weight: bool | None | str = '$UNCHANGED$') → LinearRegression[source]
Configure whether metadata should be requested to be passed to the score method.

Note that this method is only relevant when this estimator is used as a sub-estimator within a meta-estimator and metadata routing is enabled with enable_metadata_routing=True (see sklearn.set_config). Please check the User Guide on how the routing mechanism works.

The options for each parameter are:

True: metadata is requested, and passed to score if provided. The request is ignored if metadata is not provided.

False: metadata is not requested and the meta-estimator will not pass it to score.

None: metadata is not requested, and the meta-estimator will raise an error if the user provides it.

str: metadata should be passed to the meta-estimator with this given alias instead of the original name.

The default (sklearn.utils.metadata_routing.UNCHANGED) retains the existing request. This allows you to change the request for some parameters and not others.
